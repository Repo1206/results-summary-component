### Continued development

I will need to focus on learning more about positioning for my future projects as well as mastering css grid

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl) - The following resources helped me understand hsl. before doing this challenge i had no idea what it was and was a little intimidated at first. after doing some research and becoming a little more comfortable with them i may utilize hsl in future projects. I also received help from some youtube videos when i got stuck on some topics.
